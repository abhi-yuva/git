Scenario 1:
I have 4 developers working in single application, all the 4 developers will be accesing the same repository at a time. They will be working on the repository paralelly and will be
pushing the changes to the repository on daily basis.

Solution: Branches
go for individual branch where they can work on their own branch and develop the code and at the end when needed merge the changes with the master branch

Scenario 2:
Let say I have 2 customer, here Both the customers are accessing the same application but both need 2 different option in application.

I want to undo my changes easily
